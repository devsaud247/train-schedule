Certainly! Here's an example README file you can include with your project to provide an overview and instructions for running the train schedule service:

# Train Schedule Service

The Train Schedule Service is a web service built with Django and Django Rest Framework that manages train schedules for a specific train station. It allows clients to add train schedules for different train lines running through the station and provides the ability to retrieve the next simultaneous train arrival time.

## Features

- Add train schedules for different train lines running through the station.
- Retrieve the next simultaneous train arrival time after a specified time.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Django 3.x
- Django Rest Framework 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devsaud247/train-schedule.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd train-schedule-service
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Apply the database migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. Access the API endpoints:

   - To add a train schedule, send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/api/trains/` with the train line name and schedule as the payload.
   - To get the next simultaneous train arrival time, send a GET request to `http://localhost:8000/api/trains/next_simultaneous/` with the `time` query parameter in the format HH:MM AM/PM.

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/trains/`: Add a train schedule
- `GET /api/trains/next_simultaneous/?time=<time>`: Get the next simultaneous train arrival time

## Testing

To run the test cases, execute the following command:

   ```bash
   python manage.py test
   ```

The test cases cover the following scenarios:

- Creating a new train schedule.
- Retrieving the next simultaneous train arrival time.
- Retrieving the next simultaneous train arrival time when there is no simultaneous time.
- Retrieving the next simultaneous train arrival time on the next day.

## Key-Value Store

The train schedules are stored in a SQLite database. The SQLite database is used by default in this project. If you prefer to use a different database, update the `DATABASES` setting in `settings.py` accordingly.

## Assumptions

- All train schedules are stored in a single database table (`TrainSchedule`) with fields for name and schedule.
- Train schedules are represented as a comma-separated list of arrival times in the format HH:MM AM/PM.
- The service assumes that the train schedules remain consistent throughout the day and do not vary based on weekends or holidays.
